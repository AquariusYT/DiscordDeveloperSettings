# DiscordDeveloperSettings
Made by Aquarius#1784

This enables the Developer Settings menu in Discord's settings. From there, you can enable Custom Themes, Add-ons, Custom CSS and other cool perks like showing badges next to usernames (Nitro, HypeSquad e.t.c.). This version works with Discord TL-04 and lower (windows) and Discord Version 10.3.0 and lower (android).
